# Mobile-Robotics-Assignment---3
Two View Sparse Reconstruction
The objective of this assignment is to reconstruct the scene being captured from a calibrated monocular camera. For
this assignment I have reconstructed a sparse set of points in the scene using only two views (images of the
same scene taken from different locations

The images are located in the images folder and the calibration matrix
is given below:

K = [558.7087 0.0000 310.3210] 
    [0.0000 558.2827 240.2395]
    [0.0000 0.0000 1.0000]
